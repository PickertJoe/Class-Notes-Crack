# Secondary Treatment of Wastewater

## Microbes in Wastewater
### Requirements for Growth
1. Macronutrients (C,N,P,etc)
2. Micronutrients (trace metals, vitamins)
3. Terminal electron acceptors (O2, alternatives)
* Friendly environmental conditions:
    * Moisture
    * Temperature
    * pH

### What is an Electron Acceptor?
* Respiration: the basic reaction for bacterial growth
    ```
    CH2O + O2 -> CO2 + Sugar/Energy
    ```
* An electron acceptor takes up the electrons released by organic matter as it is converted to CO2
* Oxygen is the must common (known as aerobic respiration)

### The Metabolic (Electron Acceptor) Cascade
1. Oxygen
2. Nitrate
3. Iron(III) / Manganese (IV)
4. Sulfate
5. CO2
6. Methane

### Microbial Biochemistry
* In secondary treatment, O2 is used as the electron acceptor
    * Provides fastest BOD removal and highest growth rates
    * Allows for most efficient tank design
* Supplementary O2 is bubbled through the wastewater
* Oxygen is consumed by both organic matter oxidation and cell growth/maintenance activities
* Different stages of wastewater treatment utilize different metabolic pathways
    * Denitrification (tertiary)
    * Sulfate reduction in sewers (SO4 -> H2S)
    * Sludge digestion (Organic C -> CH4)

### Modeling Bacterial Population and Growth
* Monod equation plots growth rate constant against limiting food concentration during log-growth phase
    * Both substrate and biomass concentrations measured in mg/L
    * Only models organismal growth, not death
    * Bacterial die-off modeled as a first-order reaction
* Cell yield (Y) relates cell growth to actual BOD removal
    * Values typically range from 0.4-0.8

## The Activated Sludge Process

### General Info
* Mixes bacteria with wastewater to provide a high rate of BOD removal
* Became dominant secondary treatment process by 1930s
* Significantly advanced by Dr. Ross McKinney at KU

### Two Step Process
1. Aeration tank: bacteria and wastewater are combined in a mixed liquor. Mixing and O2 provided by forced air
2. Secondary settling tank: allows for removal of cells and other remaining solids before disinfection
    * Settled bacteria are returned to aeration tank to provide a constant supply, limit waste

### Mass Balance
* Most secondary treatment design revolves around mass balance
    * Additions of a given components into a system must be balanced out by removals or storage
* For BOD, the mass in and mass out is NOT equal
    * We are converting soluble BOD into new cells
* Assumes roughly steady-state conditions
    * Flow of water into and out of system remains fairly constant
