# Wastewater Regulation & Treatment

## General Notes on Constituents

### Primary Goals of Wastewater Treatment
1. Protect public health
2. Maintain receiving water quality
3. Recover/safely dispose of residual products

### Commonly Regulated Wastewater Contaminants
1. Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
2. Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD)
3. Pathogens
4. Nitrogen & Phosphorous
* Standard NPDES permit limits are 30mg/L for TSS & BOD
* The addition of nitrogen and phosphorous to permits has been a more recent development

### Breaking Down Wastewater Solids
* Can generally be subdivided into 2 parts
    1. Grit: inorganic solids (sand, gravel, etc) with specific gravity >= 2.5
    2. TSS: smaller and lighter particles, composed mostly of organic matter

### Classifying Suspended Solids
* Suspended solids break down into two categories:
    1. Volatile suspended solids (VSS): particles that break down during heating at 550C
    2. Non-volatile suspended solids (NVSS): particles that remain intact after this combustion
* VSS is a good proxy for cell mass during secondary treatment

### Biochemical Oxygen Demand
* Measure of the impact of wastewater organic matter on the oxygen levels of the receiving water body
* Governed by organic matter biodegredation
```
CH2O + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + Energy
```
* A significant portion of BOD derives from TSS

## Overview of Treatment Process

### Types of Nitrogen in Analytical Measurement
1. Total N: Measures all nitrogen present
2. Ammonia-N: measures combination of ammonium (NH4+) and ammonia (NH3) present
3. Total Kjeldahl Nitrogen (TKN): ammonia-N + organic-N

### General Steps in Treatment
1. Preliminary Treatment: trash removal and flow regulation
2. Primary Treatment: removal of TSS
3. Secondary Treatment: removal of BOD
4. Disinfection: pathogen control
5. Tertiary Treatment: removal of phosphorous, nitrogen, and other deliterious nutrients

### Prelimary Treatment
* Initial monitering and trash removal
    * At the inlet: bar screens, flow measurements, lift pumps
    * At the surface: coarse & fine screens OR macerators/grinders
    * Design of trash removal units governed by flow velocity, headloss, and aperture size
* Passage to the grit chamber
    * Designed to remove inert dense material (sand, broken glass, etc)
    * Doesn't effectively separate organic solids
    * Meant to protect pumps from abrasion
    * Chamber design based on density difference between incoming materials
* Equalization basin
