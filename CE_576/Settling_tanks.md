# Settling Tanks & Primary Treatment

## Circular Settling Tanks
* More efficient use of space on a per-tank basis
* Easier to remove sludge
* Better for small to medium flow plants
* Maximum size limit due to diameter restrictions

## Rectangular Tanks
* Easier to stack multiple tanks next to each other (shared walls)
* Better for high volume treatment plants
* Simpler flow patterns, easier to create hydraulic models

## Major Terms Primary Settling Basin
* Freeboard depth: distance between water level and top of tank
* Sidewater depth: dpeth of settling zone (weirs to top of sludge)
* Target detention time = V / Q

### Typical Flow Path: Circular Basin
1. Wastewater influent (pre-settling)
2. Water flows down under baffles
3. Water flows outwards and upward towards weirs along tank perimeter
4. Settled solids are removed from the bottom of the tank

### Overflow Rate
* The upward velocity of water in the settling zone determines the rate of particle removal
    * This is known as the overflow velocity (vo)
* Consider a particle with settling velocity vs:
    * If vs > vo, the particle will fall to the settling zone
    * If vs < vo, the particle will remmain in the water as it flows over the weir
* Because vs depends primarily on particle size, we assume 100% removal for particles over a certain diameter and 0% removal for smaller particles
