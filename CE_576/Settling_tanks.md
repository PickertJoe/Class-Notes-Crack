# Settling Tanks & Primary Treatment

## Circular Settling Tanks
* More efficient use of space on a per-tank basis
* Easier to remove sludge
* Better for small to medium flow plants
* Maximum size limit due to diameter restrictions

## Rectangular Tanks
* Easier to stack multiple tanks next to each other (shared walls)
* Better for high volume treatment plants
* Simpler flow patterns, easier to create hydraulic models

## Major Terms Primary Settling Basin
* Freeboard depth: distance between water level and top of tank
* Sidewater depth: dpeth of settling zone (weirs to top of sludge)
* Target detention time = V / Q

### Typical Flow Path: Circular Basin
1. Wastewater influent (pre-settling)
2. Water flows down under baffles
3. Water flows outwards and upward towards weirs along tank perimeter
4. Settled solids are removed from the bottom of the tank

### Overflow Rate
* The upward velocity of water in the settling zone determines the rate of particle removal
    * This is known as the overflow velocity (vo)
* Consider a particle with settling velocity vs:
    * If vs > vo, the particle will fall to the settling zone
    * If vs < vo, the particle will remmain in the water as it flows over the weir
* Because vs depends primarily on particle size, we assume 100% removal for particles over a certain diameter and 0% removal for smaller particles

### Density Based Separation for Grit Removal
* Short settling time
* Compact settling chambers
* Avoids particle resuspension

### Aerated Grit Chambers
* Operate by "turning" grit particles via circulation so that they colide with walls
* This in turn kills their momentum, promotes settling
* Design parameters:
    * Detention time
    * Unit size (L*W*H)
    * Flow velocity
    * Air supply rate

### Vortexting Grit Chambers
* Similar to aerated chambers but with even shorter dention times
    * 10-30 seconds
* Design parameters include:
    * Detention time
    * Power input
    * Chamber size
* Are vertically oriented while aerated chambers are horizontal
