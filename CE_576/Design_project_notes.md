# CE 576 Design Project Notes

## Primary Goals
* Address a bigger issue with real world relevance
* Work with an open-ended project
* Multiple possible approaches
* Multiple possible answers

## Learning Objectives

### Content Based
* Learn more about some aspect of DW/WW treatment
* Learn to work with state regulations
* Analyze possibilities and choose an approach
* Learning how to deal with uncertaintity and limited information

### Non-Content Based
* Experience with presenting and explaining your work
* Working in project teams
* Researching new topics

## Design Partner: The City of Lawrence
### Addresses two pressing topics:
1. Kaw River Wastewater Treatement Plant Expansion
2. Farmland Industries Remediation Project
### Design Goals
* Expand the existing model of secondary treatment processes to address new nutrient removal requirements
* Something else...
### Information Provided
* Data on Kaw River Treatment plant estimated WW flows and composition
* Data on Farmland water volumes and compositions
* Biowin model of the Kaw River WWTTP secondary treatment process developed by Roopa Matole in 2013

## Project Deliverables
1. Written report
2. Biowin models developed during process
3. 8-10 minute presentation

## Notes on Farmland Industries
### Background Re: City of Lawrence
* Former fertilizer plant and active RCRA site
* The City of Lawrence inherited a Remedial Action Plan with the Kansas Department of Health & Environment when it purchased the site
* Primary pollutants: ammonia and nitrate (severe groundwater contamination)
* Safe limit for nitrate in drinking water is 10mg/L
* Containment ponds not evaporating at the same rate as they're being filled
* At one point the city had to dump a bunch of nitrogen water to the Kansas River; WaterOne got angry
* This site has an active NPDES permit
* The City of Lawrence has five NPDES permits in total
### What Happened Next?
* The City submitted an RFP (request for proposals) for plans to revise the existing Remedial Action Plan
    * This was needed because the hydraulic containment plan was found to be inadequate
* The City is no longer actively pumping groundwater from this site
    * An encircling ring of wells are being monitored for nitrate concentrations; if they start to increase again, pumping of the water table will need to resume
* The City would like to encapsulate all of its current NPDES permits into an integrated plan to increase flexibility

## Questions to Answer
* If the water were to be directly piped from the site to the Wakarusa Treatment Plant, would it be able to handle the N load from the water
    * It CAN handle the volume of water itself
* This water has a high concentration to TDS (total dissolved solids) that could prove corrosive to any pipe material
* Transport of water will be assumed to be simple
    * No considerations for piping material/cost
    * Water composition remains the same
