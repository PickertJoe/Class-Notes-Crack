# Notes on T-Beams and f'm

## Why Are Masonry Codes So Conservative?
* Their primary news sources are Rush Limbaugh and Ben Shapiro
* Code can't predict all scenarious
* Occasional wide variety in test results
* Masonry is difficult to model
* Affected by curing conditions
* Highly dependent on workmanship

## Masonry Assemblages
* Complex relationship of materials
* Codes are conservative
* f'm can be taken from codes or determined empirically through test prisms

## Prisms Tests
* TMS 602 Spec 1.4B
* Prism testing is recommended (f'm must exceed 1500psi for concrete masonry and 2600psi for clay masonry)
* Prisms are to be constructed using actual materials used in the project
* Walls are to be partially grouted
* If two prisms are constructed, one if to be grouted while the other is to ungrouted
* Use at least 3 sample prisms cured for a minimum of 28 dyas
* 5 sample tests are recommended to be used
* Average of test results must meet or exceed f'm
* If prism tests are used to determine f'm, it must be the lesser of:
    1. The average tested strength
    2. 1.25x the lowest strength multiplied by a correction factor
* Prism testing CAN be substituted for unit/grout testing

## Unit Sampling to Determine f'm
* Use block/compressive strength + mortar type to select assumed f'm from TMS 402 Tables 1 & 2
    * Assumes values in tables are typically conservative
    * Tables values may be interpolated
* Requirements of this method:
    * Units sampled must be tested for conformity with ASTM standards
    * Bed joints not to exceed 5/8"
    * Grout to conform to article 2.2
* In the past, unit sampling was required both before and during construction. Grout testing was required and mortar proportions and types had to be submitted
    * Now, it depends on the level of quality assurance required


## Causes of Flexural Stress in Beams & Non-Load Bearing Walls
1. Out-of-plane loads:
    * Vertical load eccentricity
    * Wind, seismic, or lateral loads
    * Negative moments, fixity
    * Accidental eccentricity (variations in construction)

## Reinforced Masonry Bearing Walls
* Walls are the basic masonry unit as opposed to beams & columns (as in concrete)
* Early codes set max height/thickness(h/t) ratio to require proportionality of walls
* Old code h/t standards:
    * h/t < 25 for load-bearing walls
    * h/t < 48 for non load-bearing / reinforced walls
* 1985 UBC allowed h/t > 30 if using strength design. Must consider:
    1. Influence of axial load
    2. Variable moment of inertia (due to cracking)
    3. Fixed and pinned end conditions
    4. Influence of deflection
    5. Duration of loads
* Any wall design requires:
    1. Compression check
    2. Flexural bending compression check
    3. Reinforcing design for tension stress
* TMS 402 retains empirical limits:
    1. Bearing walls (t = 6in nominal minimum)
    2. h/t for TMS 402 Table A.5.1
* 1994 and 1997 UBC introduced new allowable axial stresses based on slenderness function using the radius of gyration (instead of thickness)
    * This approach is mirrored in TMS 402
    * Based on actual testing
    * Members with h/t <= 99 fail in Euler bucking
    * H/t >= 99 were used to determine buckling load

## Combined Stresses
1. Axial:
    * Self-weight
    * Roof/floor loads
    * Parapet vertical loads
2. Bending:
    * Wind
    * Seismic
    * Pressures
    * Eccentric roof and floor loads
    * Earth pressure and surcharges
3. Compressive Bending:
    * Additive to compressive axial forces
    * fb = P/A + M/S
    * Fa = Pa/An
