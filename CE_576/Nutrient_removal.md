# Nitrogen Removal from Wastewater

## Nitrification
* This reaction can be defined as:
    ```
    NH4+ + 2O2 => NO3- + H2O + 2H+
    ```
* Differs from conventional BOD removal in that:
    * It's slower (theta and theta c are larger)
    * pH control
* Can also be constrained kinetically
    * More sensitive to temperature
* Sludge age is based on the growth rate of the nitrifying bacteria
    * Should be at least 10 days
* Theta c,min calculated using DO level and Neffluent
* Factor of safety should be >= 2.5
* pH should be within range of 6.8-8
    * The reaction itself produces H+, lowering pH
    * This can be buffered by augmenting the alkalinity of the water
    * 7.14g CaCO3 per gram of NH3 oxidized
    * NaCO3 is a suitable alternative in the absence of CaCO3

## Denitrification
* Requires anoxic (or approximate) conditions
