# Nitrogen Removal from Wastewater

## Nitrification
* This reaction can be defined as:
    ```
    NH4+ + 2O2 => NO3- + H2O + 2H+
    ```
* Differs from conventional BOD removal in that:
    * It's slower (theta and theta c are larger)
    * pH control
* Can also be constrained kinetically
    * More sensitive to temperature
* Sludge age is based on the growth rate of the nitrifying bacteria
    * Should be at least 10 days
* Theta c,min calculated using DO level and Neffluent
* Factor of safety should be >= 2.5
* pH should be within range of 6.8-8
    * The reaction itself produces H+, lowering pH
    * This can be buffered by augmenting the alkalinity of the water
    * 7.14g CaCO3 per gram of NH3 oxidized
    * NaCO3 is a suitable alternative in the absence of CaCO3

## Denitrification
* Requires anoxic (or approximate) conditions

## Preanoxic vs Postanoxic
### Preanoix
* Allows used of influent COD/BOD as carbon source for denitrification
* Nitrified ammonia is not removed in single pass
    * Better removal with internal recycle
* More complicated process to balance

### Postanoxic
* Aerobic stage comes first, so NH4+ is already oxidized
* No internal recycle required, but available carbon is depleted
* Must supply supplemental carbon source
    * Adds chemical costs and logistics to process
    * Methanol or waste glyverin are some of the cheapest solutions

## Oxidation Ditches
* Essentially combines primary and secondary treatment
* In typical operation, aerators are designed to keep system slightly aerobic
* Post-anoxic N removal can be applied in odication ditches by adjusting aeration to allow anoxic zones
* This requires larger volumes and longer sludge residence times than just BOD removal
