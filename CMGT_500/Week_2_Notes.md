## Productivity Notes (cont)

### Labor Cost of Activity
* A product of labor rate and activity duration
* Activity duration is a function of: 
    1. Skill 
    2. complexity 
    3. Historical data (facts) 
    4. Job specific analysis (science)
    5.Experience/judgement (art)
* Labor rate is a function of:
    1. Direct costs
    2. Indirect costs
    3. Union/non-union

#### Indirect Labor Costs
* Social Security Tax
* Unemployment Tax
* Workers' Compensation Insurance
* Public Liability & Property Damage Insurance
* Fringe Benefits

#### Sources of Labor Rates
* Experience
* Commerical sources
* Historical records
* Sophisticated scientific models

### Material Pricing
* Material Cost = Quantity * price
* Unit price is a function of supply, demand, location, storage/disposal

## Planning & Design

### Common Mistakes in Plans & Designs
* Use of boilerplate drawings
* Missing dimensions
* Conflicts between systems
* Inconsistent notation
* Plans conflict with specifications
* Inaccurate representation of as-built conditions

### Specifications
* Spec all things described that cannot be shown on a drawing
* Specifications are sectioned according to type of craft or contractor who may do the work
* Main sections are largely standardized
* Can come in several types:
    1. Performance: design agnostic, solely concerned with ultimate performace of the deliverable
    2. Design

## Quantity Takeoff (QTO)

### Basic Definitions
* QTO is the measurement of work to be performed through interpretation of the drawings and specifications
* Alternative names: quantity surveying or stripping

### Timing of QTO
* Responsive to:
    * The skill & procedure of the estimator
    * Quality of contract documents
    * Degree of item definition

### Characteristics of Good Quantity Surveyors
1. Detail oriented / organized
2. Good plan reader
3. Patient
4. Time / scheduling / planning skill
5. Anticipate problems 
6. Contractual understanding
7. Solid code of ethics

### Typical QTO Mistakes
* Common:
    * Misreading documents
    * Incorrect entry into calculator
    * Transposition errors (switching character placing)
    * Misplaced decimal points
* Not so common?:
    * Using wrong units
    * Overloading agenda
    * Improper take-off

### QTO Measurements
* Equation for board feet
    ```
    BF = (t + w + L) / (12)
    ```
    * Where t = thickness (in)
    * w = width (in)
    * L = length (ft)

### Nominal vs Actual Dimensions
* If the nominal dimension is < 6 in: the actual dimension is reduced by half
* If the nominal dimension is >= 8 in: the actual dimension is reduced by 3/4
