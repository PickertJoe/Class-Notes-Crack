## Contract Estimation

### Contactor's Purpose of Estimation
* Determine project cost and profit
* Implement cost contorl measure
* Develop and store data that can be used for future projects

### Engineer's Purpose of Estimation
* Provide the owner with a probable estimate
* Evaluate alternatives

## Order of Magnitude Estimation

### Index Based Method
* Comparison of yearly price change
* Forecast similar project
* Location and time index
```
C = Cn * (I/In)
```
Where:
    * C = cost of facility to be built
    * I = index value of current facility
    * Cn = cost of facility already built
    * I = index value of facility already built

### Cost-Capacity Method
* Based on a project's physical site
```
C = Cn * (Q/Qn)^m
```
Where:
    * Q = capacity of current facility


### Overview of SFC Method
* BAsed on building types (residentail, school, parking, etc)
* Requires approximate size and basic parameters
* Step by step approach:
    1. Documentation of square foot cost data
    2. Analyze project data
    3. Perform adjustments (if the parameters differ from the model building)
    4. Examine additions
    5. Summary & conclusion
