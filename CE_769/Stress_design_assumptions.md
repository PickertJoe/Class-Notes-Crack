# Assume the Following Unless Otherwise Noted
1. Use medium weight block units for best fit of availability and seismic dead load weights
2. Round n to the nearest xx.x value
3. Assume beam depth = d + 4
4. Use actual width on brick members, true dimensional width on block members
6. Always use actual reinforcing bar sizes and areas
7. Use tables for beam dead loads
8. Brick 2-wythe beams may have any tie spacing (6", 8", 12", etc) since the grout is continuous between two rows of bricks. CMU and hollow core brick beams must have spacing at 8" modules since the verticla cells are at 8 inches on center, starting 4 inches from edge of the opening.
9. Simple span beams: For consistency in solution, use a flexural beam lintel length of the clear span opening plus 4 inches of bearing each side. Check the maximum shear at d/2 from the face of the clear opening unless instructed otherwise. 
10. Use actual, not nominal dimensions in ALL calculations
11. Beams are always solid grouted, even when part of a partially grouted wall
