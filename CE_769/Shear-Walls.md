# Shear Walls

## Basic Definitions
A. Shear walls are designed as deep, vertical cantilevered beams
B. Shear walls are designed as the lateral load (wind, seismic, earth) resisting system.
C. Loads are imparted to them through floor and roof diaphragms
D. Seismic forces are induced within the shear wall's own mass.
E. Masonry shear walls are usually also major building bearing walls and carry axial load as well as shear loads.
F. This overall system is referred to as a "box" system.

## Behavior of Shear Walls
1. When height is greater than width:
  * Acts more like a flexural element
  * Moment deflection is greater than shear deflection
2. When the width is greater than height:
  * Acts more like a shear shear element
  * Shear deflection is greater than the moment deflection
3. Shear steel (horizontal wall reinforcing) adds considerably to the amount of shear a wall can resist
4. Special Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls (TMS 402 7.3.2.6.1.2): the calculated shear must be increased by a factor of 1.5.
  * This added shear capacity ensures that the wall yields in flexure before developing diagonal shear cracks. Masonry walls that fail in shear have very little remaining ductility. 
5. Detailed Plain, Ordinary Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls, Intermediate Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls, Special Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls (TMS 7.3.2.3.1) have the following minimum vertical reinforcement requirements:
  * 0.2 in^2 at corners
    * Within 16 in of openings
    * Within 8 in of movement joints and ends of walls
    * 120 in O.C. max
  * Minimum horizontal reinforcement requirements:
    * W1.7 joint reinforcement at 16 in O.C
6. Vertical steel does little to increase shear resistance. Therefore, no design restriction on the addition of vertical reinforcement of shear wall.
7. Masonry resisting shear calculated by equations 8-21 through 8-24 (TMS 402 8.3.5.1)
  * For reinforced masonry shear walls, these equations are 8-25 and 8-26
8. For partially grouted shear walls, gamma sub g = 0.75

## Shear Wall: Shear Stress Design
A. The actual shear (fv = V / bL) if the wall is uncracked (TMS 402 EQN 8-21):
  * L = the actual wall length
  * b = the wall's thickness
  * Wall is considered uncracked only in walls with enough eaxial load to exceed the bending stress (fa > fb & e < L/6)
B. If the section is cracked, the shear stress is fv = V / Anv
  * Anv = b * dv
  * d is taken as the overall length minus the distance to the centroid of the tension steel
C. When web reinforcement is required, calculate per TMS 402 8.3.5.1.4 and modified equation (8-27)
  * s = 0.5 Av * Fs * dv / Anv * Fvs
