# Shear Walls

## Basic Definitions
A. Shear walls are designed as deep, vertical cantilevered beams
B. Shear walls are designed as the lateral load (wind, seismic, earth) resisting system.
C. Loads are imparted to them through floor and roof diaphragms
D. Seismic forces are induced within the shear wall's own mass.
E. Masonry shear walls are usually also major building bearing walls and carry axial load as well as shear loads.
F. This overall system is referred to as a "box" system.

## Behavior of Shear Walls
1. When height is greater than width:
  * Acts more like a flexural element
  * Moment deflection is greater than shear deflection
2. When the width is greater than height:
  * Acts more like a shear shear element
  * Shear deflection is greater than the moment deflection
3. Shear steel (horizontal wall reinforcing) adds considerably to the amount of shear a wall can resist
4. Special Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls (TMS 402 7.3.2.6.1.2): the calculated shear must be increased by a factor of 1.5.
  * This added shear capacity ensures that the wall yields in flexure before developing diagonal shear cracks. Masonry walls that fail in shear have very little remaining ductility. 
5. Detailed Plain, Ordinary Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls, Intermediate Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls, Special Reinforced Masonry Shear Walls (TMS 7.3.2.3.1) have the following minimum vertical reinforcement requirements:
