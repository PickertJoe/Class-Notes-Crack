# Notes on T-Beams and f'm

## Why Are Masonry Codes So Conservative?
* Their primary news sources are Rush Limbaugh and Ben Shapiro
* Code can't predict all scenarious
* Occasional wide variety in test results
* Masonry is difficult to model
* Affected by curing conditions
* Highly dependent on workmanship

## Masonry Assemblages
* Complex relationship of materials
* Codes are conservative
* f'm can be taken from codes or determined empirically through test prisms
    * TMS 602 Spec 1.4B
    * Prism testing is recommended (f'm must exceed 1500psi for concrete masonry and 2600psi for clay masonry)
    * Prisms are to be constructed using actual materials used in the project
    * Walls are to be partially grouted
    * If two prisms are constructed, one if to be grouted while the other is to ungrouted

## Causes of Flexural Stress in Beams & Non-Load Bearing Walls
1. Out-of-plane loads:
    * Vertical load eccentricity
    * Wind, seismic, or lateral loads
    * Negative moments, fixity
    * Accidental eccentricity (variations in construction)
