# Notes from February 3, 2020

## Working Stress Design Prior to 1933
* Generally empirical, going off rules of thumb with little consideration to calculated Stress
* Usually pretty conservative, inefficient
* 1937 Engineered reinforced masonry: low allowable stress, very conservative
* 1991 Slenderwall: strength design

## Working Stress Design
* Allowable masonry stresses
* Allowable steel stresses
* Have generally been liberalized since the 90s
* Key assumptions
    * Planar sections remain planar
    * Modulus of elasticity of constant throughout meber
    * Relationship between stress and strain
* Masonry carries no tensile strenght
* Span of member is long compared to depth
* Steel is stressed about the center of gravity
* Shear forces are uniformly distributed

## Masonry Behavior
* Cracked section
    * Tensile stress in masonry exceeds maximum
    * Tension cracks develops
    * Strains are still linear
    * Compression stress remains elastic
    * Tensile stress in reinforcing propertional to distance from neutral axis
    * Balanced deisgn occurs when both masonry and steel are at maximum allowable stress
